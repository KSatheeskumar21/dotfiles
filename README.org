* Dotfiles

This is my new repo for my dotfiles, because I want to move everything from GitLab over to GitHub.

Here you'll find my [[.config/awesome][Awesome]] config, my [[.config/spectrwm][spectrwm]] config, my [[.xmonad/][XMonad]] config, and a new LeftWM theme because I wasn't happy with my previous theme.
I also have my Emacs config in this repo.
